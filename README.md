This is a fork and current development version Entrance, a EFL based 
display manager for Enlightenment and maybe Tizen. Or any device that 
has EFL.

It is ALIVE! IT WORKS! (for me Â©)

## About
Entrance is alive and working again for logging into X sessions! The 
project has been resurrected from the dead to live on once again...

Entrance is a long story. There was a project long ago that worked, and 
went [MIA](http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html). Another came 
along [Michael Bouchaud](https://github.com/eyoz)/@eyoz and renamed his 
project elsa to Entrance. Which is where the current code base came 
from. It is not known if this ever was completed or worked, but 
presently does not function correctly if it is usable to log in at all. 

entrance should allow a user to choose a WM/Desktop session to launch.
That is the eventual goal, and long term to support Wayland in 
addition to X.

## Build
To build and install run the following

```
./autogen.sh --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr
make
make install
```

On most systems you likely need a pam file. 
```
cp data/entrance /etc/pam.d/entrance
```

There are some others, entrance.arch and entrance.other. May need other 
variations for different operating systems/linux distributions.

## Configuration
Most things can be configured in entrance.conf, /etc/entrance/entrance.conf

You could put a customized icon for your user in
/var/cache/entrance/users/(username).edj with groupname "entrance/user/icon"

## Usage
In order to start entrance you need a system init script or systemd (untested). 
This may differ based on your operating system. entrance does not 
provide an init script at this time, and likely will not run if started
directly. Entrance should be invoked via init script or systemd service. 
There is a provided systemd service file for entrance in the  

## Systemd
Any support there will likley be dropped as well. Elogind/logind 
function maybe retained.
