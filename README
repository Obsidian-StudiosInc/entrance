What entrance do:
open session with pam
User can choose the WM to open
Admin can make a script who are called to open session (/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc)
Everything can be configured in elsa.conf

You could put an customized icon for your user in /var/cache/elsa/users/(username).edj with groupname "elsa/user/icon"

to enable grub2 reboot feature use --enable-grub2 on configure. But you need to
add this line 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' to /etc/default/grub

build and install:
./autogen.sh --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr
make
make install

on debian (ubuntu) you need to overide the pam file.
cp data/entrance.debian /etc/pam.d/entrance
