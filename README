What entrance can do:
open session with pam
User can choose the WM to open
Admin can make a script who are called to open session (/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc)
Everything can be configured in entrance.conf

You could put a customized icon for your user in
 /var/cache/entrance/users/(username).edj with groupname "entrance/user/icon"
BIG THX to http://tux.crystalxp.net for tux g1 ! Specificaly to all authors of
each tux present in this build.

to enable grub2 reboot feature use --enable-grub2 on configure. But you need to
add this line 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' to /etc/default/grub

build and install:
./autogen.sh --sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr
make
make install

On some systems (not debian like), you need to overide the pam file. Please try
cp data/entrance.other /etc/pam.d/entrance
or copy one of slim, gdm, kdm ... pam file to /etc/pam.d/entrance
